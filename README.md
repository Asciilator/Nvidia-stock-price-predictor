i. a brief description of the project

ii. the algorithm / library / methods that you want to use

5. Statistical predictions (Simple):
For given real-world data, retrieve a statistical model. Compare the performance of the statistical prediction when provided inputs not seen by the statistical model before. Plot the prediction overlaid on actual data.

Given annual growth in global GDP and that of the US, predict the price of the iPhone for September 2024.

For autumn and winter, given the amount of solar radiation and the temperature recorded in the Netherlands in the past 5 days, predict the rainfall for the next 2 days.
